# BUBC Universal Bookmark Converter

# Description
The BUBC Universal Bookmark Converter, or BUB Converter for short, is a program designed to allow for a more easier transition from different browsers. 

While desktop browsers generally have sufficient built-in tools for transferring bookmarks, especially with the popular browsers like Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, or Opera, many mobile browsers, especially more niche or less known ones generally do not have tools to transfer bookmarks between browsers. Even popular mobile browsers like Firefox Mobile cannot import bookmarks unless done so in an indirect manner such as going through the desktop application and then enabling sync.

This tool is meant to solve this problem. The BUB Converter accepts bookmark files from different browsers, and then convers them to the bookmark layout and file of the desired browser.

As for now, only CM Browser to Firefox bookmark file conversion will be possible.
